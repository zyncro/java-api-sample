Java Api Example
================
This example shows how to use the Zyncro REST API from Java.

We use [Scribe](https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java "Scribe") as the OAuth client library.

`ZyncroApiSample.java` shows how to get a validated Access Token and invoke two API services. One to get the microblogging and another to post a new message.

In a real world app you can store the Access Token and reuse it.
